# Voxon Developers Kit

 Welcome to the Voxon Developers Kit. the official pathway **to developing content for Voxon’s volumetric technology.**  Inside the Developers Kit are a range of tools, documents, and examples to develop volumetric media and software. 

The Developer Kit aims to:

1)  Introduce our volumetric technology and the core concepts of using our volumetric software for development purposes.
2)  Allow developers to compile their own VX apps
3)  Inform media creators how to produce content for our displays and understand how to use advanced media types such as DICOM imaging and VoxieOS Animation sequences 
4)  Make it accessible for 3rd party software to integrate with our technology. 
5)  An easy one package install with a logical layout. 


It is developed for a range of skill sets - beginner, professional and in-between.

Our goals for the Developer Kit are as follows:

·     **To be easy**, **empowering** and **effective** 
·     **To be extendable **- users can use the examples provided it to build upon their vision.
·     **To be enabling** - users can see the potential for volumetric experiences and be inspired. 

The latest stable version of the Developers Kit is hosted on our website : www.voxon.co
The latest version of the Developers Kit is always hosted on our GitHub page: https://github.com/Voxon-Photonics/Content-Developers-Kit

**System requirements: The Voxon Developers Kit requires a Windows based machine any system that can run Windows 10 or newer should be compatible.**

## Installation

To install the Developers Kit either run the *Voxon Installer* obtained from our website [**www.voxon.co**](http://www.voxon.co), or manually (sideload) unzip the files into a folder. We recommend installing the Developers Kit to ‘C:\Voxon’, and run the *Set Path and Registry.bat* file located under the ‘System/Setup’ folder to set Path and Registry settings. This will ensure your system is set up properly. 

 

##  Directory and file structure for the Developers Kit
