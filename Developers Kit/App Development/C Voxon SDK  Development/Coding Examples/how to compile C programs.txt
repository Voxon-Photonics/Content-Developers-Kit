To compile, launch a Visual C/C++ Command Prompt (requires Visual Studio to be installed), cd to the appropriate directory, and type:
    nmake filename.c
The makefile is embedded at the top of source code. Be sure to compile for 64-bit target. 

Make sure to include the voxiebox.h file into the appropriate directory which can be located in in the 'Headers and DLLs' folder under the C Voxon SDK Development
