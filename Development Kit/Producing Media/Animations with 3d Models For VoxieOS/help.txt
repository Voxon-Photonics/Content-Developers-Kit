A zipped file of models named in sequence can be played in VoxieOS as an animation.

steps to make an animations playable in VoxieOS 

1) rename the 3d models (which can be .obj, .stl or .kv6) in sequence

Example : if your filenames are ‘fish’ you could name them as Fish00.kv6,Fish01.kv6
Fish02.kv6,Fish03.kv6,Fish04.kv6 this would play the five frames in sequence.

2) create a new file and call it info.ini
3) edit info.ini to define parameters
4) zip the files into a single archive

For a full example unzip the fish.zip and have a look at the contents.

Parameters for edit Info


animfile=fish%02d.kv6           //limited printf-style formatting to select files in order. Typically: file%d.ext or file%0#d.ext
animsnd=undwat.flac             //audio file to play
animscale=2.0;				//default scale
animmode=1;                     //0=forward, 1=pingpong
animfps=20.0;                   //frames per second (default is 15)
animforcescale=1.0;             //set a forced scale - useful when animation frames vary in size
anim_autocycle_loops=1;         //in autocycle mode, tells how many loops to play before next file
//anim_autocycle_seconds=5;     //in autocycle mode, tells how long seconds to play before next file
//anim_autocycle_nokillsound=0; //continue audio playback after changing animation
anim_reset_posori=1;            //reset pos & ori?
anim_showtim[0]=0.5;            //custom animation sequence. Ttime in seconds.
anim_showrat[0]=0.2;            //ratio from 1st to last frame:{0.0..1.0}
anim_showtim[1]=1.5;            //"
anim_showrat[1]=0.4;            //"
