Installation:

For OpenNI2 support, make sure these files are in the same directory as KNIVIEW.EXE:
   OpenNI2.dll
   OpenNI.ini (to make it search in the same directory)
   OniFile.dll (for playing an .ONI file)
   Kinect.dll (for live Kinect v1 sensor support)

For Kinect v2 support, make sure these files are in the same directory as KNIVIEW.EXE:
   kinect20.dll

For RealSense 2.0 support, make sure these files are in the same directory as KNIVIEW.EXE:
   realsense2.dll

For Voxiebox support, make sure these files are in the same directory as KNIVIEW.EXE:
   voxiebox.dll (needed for running on the voxiebox or voxiebox emulator)
   voxiebox.ini (voxiebox.dll settings)
   voxiebox_menu0.ini (voxiebox.dll settings - included from voxiebox.ini)

KNIView settings are stored here:
   kniview.ini

   The .KNI file format can be played without any external DLLs. ;-) KNI files may contain videos recorded from a Kinect v2 or RealSense 2.0.
   Also stored is the calibration and audio data. Use KNIFE.EXE to make KNI recordings.

Command line usage:
   >kniview [.KNI/.ONI file] [options] [/a WAV/FLAC file]

If no file is specified, the default device is a live connected camera, such as the Kinect for Windows sensor.

Options:
   /o: select input device: OpenNI2 library
   /k: select input device: Microsoft Kinect v2
   /r: select input device: RealSense 2 (SR300, D415, ..)

   /w: select output device: render in a 2d window (default)
   /v: select output device: enable Voxiebox mode (must have voxiebox.dll and voxiebox.ini in directory)
   /3: select output device: enable Nvidia 3DVision mode

   /ir: select infrared instead of RGB color (for live OpenNI2)

   /a: specify WAV/FLAC file to play
   /b: specify brightness offset (0 .. 10)
   /t: specify # threads to use
   /d#x#(x#): specify depth buffer resolution and fps (optional). Examples: /d1280x720x30 or /d512x424
   /c#x#(x#): specify color buffer resolution and fps (optional). Examples: /c1920x1080x30 or /c640x480

   /H: host TCP connection
   /J[ip address or server name of TCP host]: connect to TCP host (must specify ip). Examples: /J:192.168.1.100 or /J:localhost

   /h: host UDP connection
   /j[ip address or server name of UDP host]: connect to UDP host (must specify ip). Examples: /j:192.168.1.100 or /j:localhost

   /p: override TCP or UDP port. Example /p:32123

In-app controls:

ESC:quit

   Camera:
FYI: the Space navigator is supported. This is the recommended way to control camera pos & ori.
1-4        select camera
`          select all cameras
Arrows     forward/back/left/right
RCtrl      up
KP0,RMenu,L.Enter  down
Mouse      rotate camera (voxiebox mode: spin camera & walk forward)
LMB+Mouse  rotate camera free direction (voxiebox mode only)
RMB+Mouse  zoom camera (voxiebox mode only)
,/.        rotate around model horizontally
PGUP/PGDN  rotate around model vertically
/          reset camera
KP/,KP*:   change zoom
A,Z:       change zoom
KP5:       reset zoom
L.Shift:   hold for 16x slower
R.Shift:   hold for 16x faster
(/):       press to darken/brighten (speed vs. brightness tradeoff for VoxieBox mode only; 5 levels)
{/}        halve/double base flying speed
H          toggle head tracking mode for current camera
F          frustratingly attempt to restart frozen Realsense 2.0 camera

   Video:
Home/End   seek beginning/5 seconds before end of video (OPENNI2 only)
;/'        seek -/+ 5 seconds in video (OPENNI2 only)
[/]        halve/double video playback speed (OPENNI2 only)
P          pause video
M          mute audio
KP-/KP+    adjust maximum depth to crop (default:8192)
R          toggle raw video
Space      toggle Color vs. IR (always uses Depth)
X          mirror image (Voxiebox only)

   Color-Depth calibration (only for old OPENNI stuff):
LAlt+mouse   move mouse all 4 directions to adjust color/ir calibration's x&y pixel offsets
LCtrl+mouse  move mouse up/down to adjust focal range in pixels
Tab+mouse    move mouse up/down to adjust laser/ir camera separation in mm
Ctrl+S     save calibration settings to KNIVIEW.INI. Note: calibration settings are indexed by their
              detected horizontal and vertical field of view. It is assumed that each camera has
              different settings for these. Obviously, there could be conflicts. The hope is that this
              should be good enough to allow calibration to only be done once per camera .. for now.
              Obviously a better method should be devised in the future ;-)
