vox.exe -rotate_controls 216
rotates the controls to a specific orientation use 216 for Z3D or Voxon control layout

note from ZEP : [ Just in case you need a different configuration: n is an integer with pairs of bits indicate the anti-clockwise rotation (0..3) 
for each player, starting from player 1 in the lowest two bits. So for the configuration for Voxon Z3D, the rotations are 0,2,1,3 and n is 0*1 + 2*4 + 1*16 + 3*64 = 216 ]

- Internal bundled carts can also be launched using -vx_run by prefixing the cart id with ':'
