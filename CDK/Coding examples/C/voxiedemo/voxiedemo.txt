   ESC: quit immediately
   \: toggle voxiebox setup menu
   R.Alt: Hold to display motor and rendering frame rate, frequency and phase
   `: Mode Selection screen

   Voxiebox mode only:
      [/]: Modify phase by 1/100 cycle
      RMenu [/]: Modify phase by 1/1000 cycle

Mode description and keys:

'`': Mode Selection screen / screen saver
   Space/Enter: Proceed / Select
   Arrows: Change selection

UDP Height: Calibrate phase test pattern (if no UDP packets received), or:
             Render heightmap from UDP (default port is 32123). automatically rescales x/y dimensions to fill window.
   Be careful that your image file fits within the UDP maximum size of 64KB!
   F1: debug: hold to use nearest instead of bilinear filter (zoom in to see)
   F2: debug: hold to disable dither on height (shows plateaus)

Keystone Cal: Calibrate quadrilateral
   Joystick 1: move cursor x-y.
   Joystick 1 buttons,Scroll wheel,RMB: move/toggle height of cursor
   LMB: drag corner. I suggest you do top corners first.
   MMB/Space: Refine cal settings (iteratively aligns 4 corner lines (x,y,z0,z1) to pass through common focus.)

Wavy Plane: Render old stuff
   no mouse buttons: waves
   LMB: hemispheres
   LMB&RMB: pyramids
   RMB: various spheres/cubes/pyramids, rendered with high level functions
   MMB: various spheres/cubes/pyramids, rendered voxel by voxel

Height Map: Render heightmap from file
   Up to 256 DEMs may be specified in voxiedemo.ini for mode 3. For each image, the demfile=.. line must appear first.
   Any attributes (such as demscale=..) will apply to the most recent, previous demfile in voxiedemo.ini.

   PGUP/PGDN: Cycle dem file up/down
   Joystick 1 or mouse: move
   Joystick 1 ButA/B: zoom
   Joystick 1a ButA/B: zoom height axis only
   , / .: rotate

   F1: toggle height dither (shows plateaus)
   F2: toggle filter: nearest/bilinear (zoom in to see)
   F3: toggle color dither

Voxie Player: Voxie movie player (plays .REC files)
   Joystick 1 up/down: Toggle pause
   Joystick 1 ButA/B: Cycle rec file up/down

Platonic Solids: Render platonic solids.
   Joystick 1 Up/Down: set color
   Joystick 1 Left/Right: set fill mode: dots/wireframe/surfaces/solid filled

Flying Stuff: Rotating text & flying crap
   You may type stuff to change the text. Backspace works.
   You may also edit the initial message in voxiedemo.ini.

Chess:
   Joystick 1: move cursor
   ButA/Enter: grab/drop piece
   ButB: undo last move
   H: hint (computer does 1 move for you)
   Ctrl+H: toggle auto play (computer plays both)
   Backspace: reset game

Packer:
   Board is 15x8x3. Must fill 8x3 plane to remove row.
   There are 6 unique shapes (box, L, ~, half +) and 2 shapes not possible in the 2D game.

   Joysticks 1&2: move/rotate piece
   Ins/Del: rotate piece around axis 1
   Home/End: rotate piece around axis 2
   PGUP/PGDN: rotate piece around axis 3
   Enter: hold to speed up drop
   Backspace: reset game

Dot Munch:
   Arrows: move
   Backspace: reset game

Snake Tron:
   XBox controllers supported up to 4 players.
   Backspace: reset game

Model / Anim:
   P: toggle pause
   M: toggle slice view
   Joysticks 1&2: move&rotate model
   Mouse + no buttons:   rotate model, yaw&pitch
   Mouse + left button:  rotate model, free direction
   Mouse + right button: spin model on axis perpendicular to screen
   Mouse + left&right:   zoom model
   Middle button: show wireframe around model
   /: reset position & orientation
   PGUP/PGDN: if not paused: animation previous/advance. if paused: frame previous/advance
   R.Alt: also shows frame number/total, and cross section position
   Ctrl+S: save positions and orientations of each model, and current model, to ANIM.INI
   Ctrl+L: load data from ANIM.INI

Source code:
   voxiedemo.c: main program - contains everything specific to Voxiebox demos
   voxiebox.h: Header for voxiebox.dll

To compile, launch a Visual C/C++ Command Prompt, cd to the appropriate directory, and type:
    nmake voxiedemo.c
The makefile is embedded at the top of voxiedemo.c. Be sure to compile for 64-bit target.
